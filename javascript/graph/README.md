## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Implement a graph data structure that represents an adjacency list.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API

<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->

Methods Available:

- addVertex(vertex) : adds a new vertex to our graph
- addDirectedEdge(startVertex, endVertex) : connects two vertex with a directed edge
- addUndirectedEdge(startVertex, endVertex) : connects two vertex with bi-directional edge
- getSize() : returns the size of the graph
- getNeighbors(vertex) : will return all the neighbors of a given vertex
- bft() : will do a breadth first search and return a set of vertex in the graph
- dft() : will do a depth first search and return a set of vertex in the graph
